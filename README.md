## Problem Statement

Healthcare management plays a crucial role in ensuring the efficient delivery of healthcare services. This responsibility encompasses strategic planning, resource management, and regulatory compliance to enhance patient care outcomes

## Object

Our object was to delve into the multifaceted nature of healthcare management, highlighting the expertise required to optimize processes within dynamic healthcare environments. Furthermore, we explore the potential of machine learning in addressing operational challenges within healthcare. By examining various machine learning algorithms, we identify their advantages and limitations, proposing a structured method of application. Through this analysis, we aim to illuminate how machine learning can minimize patient waiting times and optimize overall healthcare operations.
